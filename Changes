Revision history for Acme-CPANAuthors-Search

0.04    Thu Mar 03 10:49:19 2011
        - Updated method by_id(), where_id_starts_with() and where_name_contains() to croak if can't
          access search.cpan.org.
        - Modified the unit test 01-test-case.t to skip the test if there is no internet access.

0.03    Wed Mar 02 12:04:21 2011
        - Upping the rev, so that correct tar ball can be uploaded to CPAN. The earlier version of
          tar ball created by make file had incorrect file permission.

0.02    Wed Mar 02 10:48:15 2011
        - Removed "-T" from the first line of 00-load.t, pod.t and manifest.t.
          It appears to me that Mac OS X doesn't like it, for some reason.

0.01    Tue Mar 01 16:45:18 2011
        - First version released.
